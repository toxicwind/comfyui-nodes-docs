# Documentation
- Class name: KfDebug_Vae
- Category: Debugging
- Output node: True
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/dmarx/ComfyUI-Keyframed

The node facilitates the analysis and visualization of the performance and behaviour of the VAE model and provides insight into the generation process and potential spatial structure.

# Input types
## Required
- image
    - The input of images is essential for node processing and analysis of data, enabling visualization of VAE's re-engineering and generation capacity.
    - Comfy dtype: Image
    - Python dtype: PIL.Image.Image
## Optional
- latent_codes
    - This parameter allows users to enter specific potential codes to explore and operate images generated by VAE and to provide a deeper understanding of the potential space of the model.
    - Comfy dtype: Tensor
    - Python dtype: torch.Tensor

# Output types
- reconstructed_images
    - The output displays a reconfigured image of VAE, provides a direct comparison with the original input and an assessment of model performance.
    - Comfy dtype: Image
    - Python dtype: PIL.Image.Image
- generated_images
    - These images represent the ability of nodes from learning to potential space to generate new data points and demonstrate the capacity of VAE to generate them.
    - Comfy dtype: Image
    - Python dtype: PIL.Image.Image

# Usage tips
- Infra type: GPU
