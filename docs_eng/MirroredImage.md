# Documentation
- Class name: MirroredImage
- Category: ♾️Mixlab/Image
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/shadowcz007/comfyui-mixlab-nodes.git

The node class is designed to create a mirror version of the image that you enter by reflecting horizontal axes. It is the basic tool in the image processing task, where mirror images can be used for various purposes, such as expanding data sets, creating visual effects or performing symmetry-based analyses.

# Input types
## Required
- image
    - Enter the parameter 'image' is the collection of images to be processed by nodes. Each image should be in a format in which the internal image processing function of the node can be read and operated. This parameter is essential because it directly determines the content and nature of the mirror image generated by the node.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO[IMAGE]
    - Python dtype: List[PIL.Image.Image]

# Output types
- IMAGE
    - The output of the node is a list of a series of mirror images. Each image in the list is the result of a horizontal reflection of the image. These mirror images can be used for various downstream applications, making the output very important for the image-related tasks.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO[IMAGE]
    - Python dtype: List[torch.Tensor]

# Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
