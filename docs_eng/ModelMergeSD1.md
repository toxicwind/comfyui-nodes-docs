Model MergeSD1 node aims to integrate multiple models seamlessly into a single framework. It achieves this by combining different model structures, allowing for a combination of their unique strengths and capabilities. This node plays a key role in advanced model consolidation, particularly in model-specific integration scenarios, enhancing the performance and adaptability of the system as a whole.

# Input types
## Required
- model1
    - The `model1' parameter is the first model to be merged within a node. It is essential to define the initial structure and behaviour of the merged model. The selection of this model will significantly influence the implementation of the node and the final outcome of the process of its integration.
    - Comfy dtype: MODEL
    - Python dtype: torch.nn.Module
- model2
    - The `model2' parameter represents the second model that is to be integrated into a consolidation framework. Its inclusion is essential for expanding the ability of results models. The purpose of integrating `modell2' with `model1' is to create a more robust and multifunctional model by combining their respective characteristics.
    - Comfy dtype: MODEL
    - Python dtype: torch.nn.Module
## Optional
- time_embed.
    - The `time_embed.' parameter is used to adjust the time embedded in the model. It is particularly important for models that take time to understand or process time series data. The values assigned to this parameter can fine-tune the sensitivity of the model to time-related characteristics.
    - Comfy dtype: FLOAT
    - Python dtype: float
- input_blocks.
    - For each index from 0 to 11, `i', `input_blocks.{}... indicates parameters that can be adjusted to modify the behaviour of the blocks in the model. These parameters are essential to fine-tune how the model handles the input and can significantly influence the implementation of nodes and the quality of the combined model projections.
    - Comfy dtype: FLOAT
    - Python dtype: float
- middle_block.
    - `middle_block.{}.' Parameters in which `i' ranges from zero to two, allowing the middle blocks in the custom model. These are critical in the intermediate processing steps of the model and can significantly influence the performance of nodes and the accuracy of model output.
    - Comfy dtype: FLOAT
    - Python dtype: float
- output_blocks.
    - Similar to `input_blocks.', for each index from 0 to 11, `output_blocks.}... is a parameter that can fine-tune model output blocks. Adjusting these parameters is essential for controlling the final forecast and ensuring that they are consistent with the desired results.
    - Comfy dtype: FLOAT
    - Python dtype: float
- out.
    - The `out.' parameter is used to control the final output of the merger model. This is an important adjustment that can directly influence the outcome of the node and allow customizing model predictions according to specific requirements.
    - Comfy dtype: FLOAT
    - Python dtype: float

# Output types
- merged_model
    - The `merged_model' output represents a combination of models generated by an integration process performed by nodes. It covers the functions of two input models and is important for further analysis or deployment in various applications.
    - Comfy dtype: MODEL
    - Python dtype: torch.nn.Module
