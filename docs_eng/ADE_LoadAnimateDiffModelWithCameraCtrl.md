# Load AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Model üé≠üÖêüÖì‚ë°
## Documentation
- Class name: ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModelWithCameraCtrl
- Category: Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/CameraCtrl
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved.git

This node is designed to load the Animat√©Diff model with integrated camera control functions, enabling the application of camera motion and adjustments directly within the Animat√©Diff framework. It helps to integrate dynamic camera control parameters into the Animat√©Diff model, thereby enhancing the animation process and achieving more complex visual effects.

## Input types
### Required
- model_name
    - Specifies the name of the motion model that you want to load. It is essential to identify the specific AnimateDiff model that will add camera control.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING]
    - Python dtype: str
- camera_ctrl
    - Defines the camera control parameters that you want to inject into the Animat√©Diff model. This input is essential for customizing camera motion and effect in the animation.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING]
    - Python dtype: str

### Optional
- ad_settings
    - The optional settings for the AnimateDiff model allow further customization of the animation process.
    - Comfy dtype: AD_SETTINGS
    - Python dtype: dict

## Output types
- MOTION_MODEL
    - Comfy dtype: MOTION_MODEL_ADE
    - A modified Animat√©Diff model incorporating camera control features was prepared for animation missions.
    - Python dtype: MotionModel

## Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
- Common nodes: unknown
