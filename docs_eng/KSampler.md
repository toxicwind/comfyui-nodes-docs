KSampler node is designed to perform sampling for given models. It controls the sampling process using a variety of parameters to ensure that high-quality potential expressions are generated. This node is essential for tasks that require the creation or operation of potential space, such as image synthesis or feature extraction.

# Input types
## Required
- model
    - Model parameters are essential for KSampler nodes, as they define the bottom model to be used for sampling. The selection of models significantly influences the performance of the nodes and the quality of the potential expressions generated.
    - Comfy dtype: MODEL
    - Python dtype: torch.nn.Module
- seed
    - Seed parameters are essential to ensure the repeatability of the sampling process. It initializes the random number generator, which affects the noise patterns used in the sampling, thus affecting the consistency and reliability of the results.
    - Comfy dtype: INT
    - Python dtype: int
## Optional
- steps
    - The step parameter determines the number of turns during the sampling process. It directly affects the level of condensation and detail generated by the potential expression. More steps usually lead to higher-quality output.
    - Comfy dtype: INT
    - Python dtype: int
- cfg
    - The cfg parameter, which represents the configuration value, plays an important role in the sampling process by controlling the model's hyper-parameters. It plays a key role in the micro-regulating point performance to obtain the best results.
    - Comfy dtype: FLOAT
    - Python dtype: float
- sampler_name
    - The sampler_name parameter specifies the sampling method to be used in KSampler nodes. Different sampling methods may produce different results, so this parameter is important for achieving the desired results in the sampling process.
    - Comfy dtype: comfy.samplers.KSampler.SAMPLERS
    - Python dtype: str
- scheduler
    - The Scheduler parameter defines the learning capability scheduler to be used in the sampling process. It is a key component for adapting learning capacity over time, which can significantly affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the sampling.
    - Comfy dtype: comfy.samplers.KSampler.SCHEDULERS
    - Python dtype: str
- positive
    - The positionive parameter provides information on the conditions of the sampling process to generate a more relevant and accurate potential expression. This is an important aspect when the target is a particular result in the sample.
    - Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING
    - Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
- negative
    - The nigative parameter is similar to the positive parameter and provides conditional information, but in this case it is used to guide the sampling process away from certain results. It helps to refine the sampling process to avoid undesirable results.
    - Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING
    - Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
- latent_image
    - The latent_image parameter represents the initial potential state of the sampling process and is used as the starting point for the sampling process. It is a key input that directly influences the final output of the node and determines the direction of the sampling.
    - Comfy dtype: LATENT
    - Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
- denoise
    - The denoise parameter controls the noise level applied during the sampling process. This is an important adjustment parameter that increases the clarity and quality of the potential expression generated.
    - Comfy dtype: FLOAT
    - Python dtype: float

# Output types
- latent
    - The latent parameter is the output of the sampling process and contains the potential expression generated. This is an important result of the KSampler node and includes the final state of the sampling process.
    - Comfy dtype: LATENT
    - Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
