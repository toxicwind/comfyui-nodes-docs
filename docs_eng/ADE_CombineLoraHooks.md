# Combine LoRA Hooks [2] üé≠üÖêüÖì
## Documentation
- Class name: ADE_CombineLoraHooks
- Category: Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/combine lora hooks
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved.git

This node is intended to bring together multiple LoRA-linked groups into a single LoRA-linked group. It helps to combine the various LoRA-linked links to achieve more complex and detailed model conditions by combining the different modifications or enhancements provided by each individual link.

## Input types
### Required
### Optional
- lora_hook_A
    - is the first LoRA-link group to be combined. It plays a key role in the process of aggregation, contributing to its modification or enhancement to the ultimate unified LoRA-link group.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_B
    - is the second LoRA-linked group to be combined. Contributes to its unique modification or enhancement to the unified LoRA-linked group and enriches the overall conditionalities.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup

## Output types
- lora_hook
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - The output is a unified LoRA-linked group, which combines changes or enhancements to input the LoRA-linked group. This polymer-linked group contributes to more complex model conditions.
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup

## Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
- Common nodes: unknown
