# Load AnimateDiff Model üé≠üÖêüÖì‚ë°
## Documentation
- Class name: ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel
- Category: Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved.git

This node is designed to load the Animat√©Diff model, which allows for the integration and application of motion models for animation purposes within the Animat√©Diff framework. It serves as the basic component in the animation pipeline, enabling users to take advantage of advanced animation techniques.

## Input types
### Required
- model_name
    - Specifies the name of the motion model that you want to load. This is a key input because it determines which motion model will be used for animation in the Animat√©Diff framework.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING]
    - Python dtype: str

### Optional
- ad_settings
    - Optional parameters, allowing for the inclusion of specific animation settings, provide additional customization and control of the animation process.
    - Comfy dtype: AD_SETTINGS
    - Python dtype: AnimateDiffSettings

## Output types
- MOTION_MODEL
    - Comfy dtype: MOTION_MODEL_ADE
    - Output loaded motion models for further processing and application in animated pipes.
    - Python dtype: MotionModelPatcher

## Usage tips
- Infra type: GPU
