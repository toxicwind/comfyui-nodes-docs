# Load CameraCtrl Poses (File) üé≠üÖêüÖì‚ë°
## Documentation
- Class name: ADE_LoadCameraPoses
- Category: Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/CameraCtrl/poses
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved.git

`ADE_LoadCameraPoses' node is designed to control the position from the specified file by loading the camera into the position so that it can be manipulated and animated within the Animat√© Diff framework. It is used as a basic element for creating dynamic and complex camera movements for animation sequences.

## Input types
### Required
- pose_filename
    - Specifies the name of the file from which you want to load the camera to control the position. This name should be a file containing the required camera position so that nodes can retrieve and use the position to animate it.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING]
    - Python dtype: str

## Output types
- cameractrl_poses
    - Comfy dtype: CAMERACTRL_POSES
    - The output of a series of camera control positions, which consist of a list of floating points indicating the position, direction and other relevant parameters of the camera in the context of the animation.
    - Python dtype: list[list[float]]

## Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
- Common nodes: unknown
