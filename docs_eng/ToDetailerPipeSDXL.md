# Documentation
- Class name: ToDetailerPipeSDXL
- Category: Image Processing
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack.git

The Todetaler PipeSDXL node is an intermediate link in the image processing stream, designed to enhance the level of detail of the image. It is achieved by fine-tuning the visual elements of the image using advanced models and technologies. The main objective of the node is to increase the clarity and sharpness of the image, making it more suitable for detailed analysis or presentation.

# Input types
## Required
- model
    - Model parameters are essential for the operation of nodes because they define the core algorithm framework for processing images. They directly affect the quality and results of image fine-tuning.
    - Comfy dtype: MODEL
    - Python dtype: torch.nn.Module
- clip
    - The clip parameter is essential to provide the context information required to enhance image details at node. It plays an important role in ensuring the contextual relevance of the output image.
    - Comfy dtype: CLIP
    - Python dtype: torch.Tensor
- vae
    - The vae parameter is a variable from the encoder, which is used by nodes to generate detailed images from input data. This is the key component of the node that can produce high-quality detailed images.
    - Comfy dtype: VAE
    - Python dtype: torch.nn.Module
- positive
    - The positionive parameter is used as a guide to the node to focus on enhancing the specific features in the image. It is important for the fine-tuning of the node to lead to the visual aspects required.
    - Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING
    - Python dtype: str
- negative
    - The negative parameter helps node to avoid adding features that are not needed in the image. It is essential to ensure that the process of fine-tuning the node meets the expectations of the user.
    - Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING
    - Python dtype: str
- refiner_model
    - The refinder_model parameter specifies an additional model for further fine-tuning detailed images generated by nodes. This is essential for achieving higher levels of detail in the final output.
    - Comfy dtype: MODEL
    - Python dtype: torch.nn.Module
- refiner_clip
    - The refiner_clip parameter provides additional context information for the refiner model in order to better refine the image. It ensures that the process is contextually conscious and accurate.
    - Comfy dtype: CLIP
    - Python dtype: torch.Tensor
- refiner_positive
    - This is essential to achieve the desired level of detail in the final image.
    - Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING
    - Python dtype: str
- refiner_negative
    - The refiner_negative parameter helps the refiner model to avoid fine-tuning unwanted features in the image. It ensures that the final image meets the userâ€™s requirements without the required details.
    - Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING
    - Python dtype: str
- bbox_detector
    - The bbox_detector parameter is used to identify and locate interest areas in the image. It is important for nodes to know where to concentrate their fine-tuning work.
    - Comfy dtype: BBOX_DETECTOR
    - Python dtype: Callable
- wildcard
    - The wildcard parameter allows dynamic text input, customizing the behaviour of the node under the conditions defined by the user. It provides flexibility in the way the image is processed at the node.
    - Comfy dtype: STRING
    - Python dtype: str
## Optional
- Select to add LoRA
    - Select to add the LoRA parameter to enable the user to select a specific low-resolution adaptation technology to enhance the performance of the model in generating detailed images.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO['Select the LoRA to add to the text', folder_paths.get_filename_list('loras')]
    - Python dtype: str
- Select to add Wildcard
    - Select to add Wildcard parameters provides an option for users to include a wildcard in their input, which can be used to introduce variability in node processing.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO['Select the Wildcard to add to the text']
    - Python dtype: str

# Output types
- detailed_image
    - This is the result of all processing and fine-tuning work at the node.
    - Comfy dtype: IMAGE
    - Python dtype: torch.Tensor

# Usage tips
- Infra type: GPU
