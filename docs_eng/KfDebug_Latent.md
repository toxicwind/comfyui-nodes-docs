# Documentation
- Class name: KfDebug_Latent
- Category: debugging
- Output node: True
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/dmarx/ComfyUI-Keyframed

The KfDebug_Latent node is designed to provide insight into potential spatial expressions based on key frame models. As a diagnostic tool, it allows for the examination and analysis of potential features, which are essential for understanding the potential structure and quality of model data processing capabilities.

# Input types
## Required
- input_data
    - The input_data parameter is the raw data entered into the node and is expected to be in the form of a PyTorch volume. It is essential because it forms the basis for potential space analysis. Input_data's quality and structure directly affect the ability of the node to generate meaningful potential expressions.
    - Comfy dtype: torch.Tensor
    - Python dtype: torch.Tensor

# Output types
- latent_representation
    - The output of latent_representation provides potential post-processing spatial data from node analysis. It is important because it contains information extracted from input_data and provides an enrichment view of potential characteristics. This output is useful for further study or visualization of the potential space.
    - Comfy dtype: torch.Tensor
    - Python dtype: torch.Tensor

# Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
