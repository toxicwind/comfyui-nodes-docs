# Documentation
- Class name: CR_CombineSchedules
- Category: Animation/Schedule
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/RockOfFire/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes

The CR_CombineSchedules node is designed to combine multiple animation schedules into a single, coherent schedule. It does so by consolidating the calendar provided to ensure a smooth transition between different animation phases without conflict. This node plays a key role in simplifying animation workflows, particularly for complex animations that require synchronizing multiple schedules.

# Input types
## Optional
- schedule_1
    - The first animation schedule that you want to group. This is a key input, because it sets the initial structure for the merged timetable. Node is smart enough to integrate the schedule, while ensuring compatibility with subsequent input.
    - Comfy dtype: SCHEDULE
    - Python dtype: List[str]
- schedule_2
    - The second animation schedule that you want to merge. This input allows further customization and extension of the group, adding more animation control layers.
    - Comfy dtype: SCHEDULE
    - Python dtype: List[str]
- schedule_3
    - The third option is the animation schedule, which can be included in the grouping process. It provides additional flexibility for the entire animation sequence.
    - Comfy dtype: SCHEDULE
    - Python dtype: List[str]
- schedule_4
    - The fourth optional animation schedule can be integrated into the final set of schedules. It provides the last layer of customization before the schedule is merged.
    - Comfy dtype: SCHEDULE
    - Python dtype: List[str]

# Output types
- SCHEDULE
    - The assembly schedule generated by the consolidation process. It represents the unified animation command sequence to be applied.
    - Comfy dtype: SCHEDULE
    - Python dtype: List[str]
- show_text
    - The text of the group schedule indicates that it applies to debugging and visualizing purposes. It provides a readable format for the merged animation instructions.
    - Comfy dtype: STRING
    - Python dtype: str
