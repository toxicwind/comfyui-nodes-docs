# Combine LoRA Hooks [8] üé≠üÖêüÖì
## Documentation
- Class name: ADE_CombineLoraHooksEight
- Category: Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/combine lora hooks
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved.git

This node is intended to combine up to eight LoRA links into a single LoRA-linked group. It helps to integrate multiple LoRA-linked changes and allows for more complex and detailed adjustments in model behaviour in the generation task.

## Input types
### Required
### Optional
- lora_hook_A
    - is the first LoRA-linked group that you want to group. It acts as a foundation during the aggregation process, setting the initial conditions for the combined LoRA-linked group.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_B
    - is the second LoRA-linked group that you want to group. The changes it contains expand the capacity and range of modifications of the LoRA-linked group that you want to group.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_C
    - As the third LoRA-link group in the configuration process, additional modifications were made that further enriched the function of the LoRA-linked group after the configuration.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_D
    - The fourth LoRA-linked group, which is meant to be combined, adds a diversity of changes in the LoRA-linked group after the configuration.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_E
    - As the fifth LoRA-linked group in the configuration process, the post-consolidated LoRA-linked group was enhanced by the introduction of more fine adjustments.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_F
    - The sixth LoRA-linked group, which indicated that it was to be combined, contained changes that broadened the scope of the LoRA-linked group after the configuration.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_G
    - As the seventh LoRA-linked group in the configuration process, it added complexity and depth to the post-LoRA-linked group.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup
- lora_hook_H
    - As the eighth and last group to be combined, the LoRA link group completed the aggregation and maximized the modifications and adjustments in the LoRA link group after the combination.
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup

## Output types
- lora_hook
    - Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK
    - This group can apply a comprehensive set of modifications to model behaviour.
    - Python dtype: LoraHookGroup

## Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
- Common nodes: unknown
