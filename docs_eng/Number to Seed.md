# Documentation
- Class name: WAS_Number_To_Seed
- Category: WAS Suite/Number/Operations
- Output node: False

The WAS_Number_To_Seed node is designed to convert values into seed formats. It is the basic tool in the WAS package and promotes operations that require seed-based methods. The node abstractes the complexity of seed generation and ensures seamless integration with downstream processes that rely on feed input.

# Input types
## Required
- number
    - The `number' parameter is essential for the operation of the node, as it is the input value of the node that will be converted to a seed. It plays a key role in determining the properties of the exported seed, which can significantly influence the follow-up process of using such a sub in the WAS package.
    - Comfy dtype: NUMBER
    - Python dtype: Union[int, float]

# Output types
- seed
    - `Seed' output is a key element generated by the WAS_Number_To_Seed node. It represents a seed that has been converted from input numbers and is essential to start the process of using seeds for implementation in the WAS package.
    - Comfy dtype: SEED
    - Python dtype: Dict[str, Union[int, float]]

# Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
