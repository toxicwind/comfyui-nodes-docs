# Documentation
- Class name: SeargeImageSaving
- Category: UI_INPUTS
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/jobunk/SeargeSDXL.git

The node coordinates the preservation of the images generated by the process, allows customizing the parameters associated with the preservation of different resolution images and is selectively embedded in the workflow.

# Input types
## Required
- save_parameters_file
    - This parameter determines whether the parameters for image preservation should be preserved, which is essential for retaining the settings used for image generation.
    - Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN
    - Python dtype: bool
- save_folder
    - The saving folder for which the image is generated is essential for organizing and accessing the output of the image generation process.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO
    - Python dtype: str
- save_generated_image
    - Decide whether to preserve the image originally generated, affecting the preservation and availability of the main output of the image generation process.
    - Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN
    - Python dtype: bool
- embed_workflow_in_generated
    - This controls whether workflow information is included in the image generated, enhancing the context and traceability of the image creation process.
    - Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN
    - Python dtype: bool
- generated_image_name
    - Specifies the filename for generating the image, which is important for identifying and quoting the output in the system.
    - Comfy dtype: STRING
    - Python dtype: str
- save_high_res_image
    - Indicate whether the high-resolution version of the image should be preserved, affecting the quality of the image and its usefulness for its further use.
    - Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN
    - Python dtype: bool
- embed_workflow_in_high_res
    - Determining whether high-resolution images should contain embedded workflow information is important for maintaining the integrity and context of image creation.
    - Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN
    - Python dtype: bool
- high_res_image_name
    - Defines the filename for high-resolution images and ensures that outputs are easily differentiated and accessible in the system.
    - Comfy dtype: STRING
    - Python dtype: str
- save_upscaled_image
    - Controlling the preservation of an enlarged version of the image is important for applications that require greater dimensions and without loss of detail.
    - Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN
    - Python dtype: bool
- embed_workflow_in_upscaled
    - This specifies whether magnification images should include workflow information to ensure that the scaling process is documented and traceable.
    - Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN
    - Python dtype: bool
- upscaled_image_name
    - Set up file names for magnifying images, which are essential for managing and quoting enhanced resolution outputs in the system.
    - Comfy dtype: STRING
    - Python dtype: str
## Optional
- data
    - This parameter serves as a container of additional data that may be required during image preservation to ensure flexibility and adaptability in various scenarios.
    - Comfy dtype: SRG_DATA_STREAM
    - Python dtype: Any

# Output types
- data
    - The output contains configured image preservation parameters and provides a structured format, which is essential for the downstream process to execute image preservation as expected.
    - Comfy dtype: SRG_DATA_STREAM
    - Python dtype: Dict[str, Any]

# Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
