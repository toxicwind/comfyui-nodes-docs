# üß™Inject I2V into AnimateDiff Model üé≠üÖêüÖì‚ë°
## Documentation
- Class name: ADE_InjectI2VIntoAnimateDiffModel
- Category: Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/AnimateLCM-I2V/üß™experimental
- Output node: False
- Repo Ref: https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved.git

This node is intended to integrate the I2V (Image to Video) model into the Animat√©Diff framework and enhance its functionality by introducing motion models. It serves as a bridge to enrich the Animat√©Diff animation process and to increase the number of motion dynamics, thus enabling more complex and detailed animations to be produced.

## Input types
### Required
- model_name
    - The designation of the name of the motion model to be loaded plays a crucial role in determining the motion dynamics of the animation.
    - Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING]
    - Python dtype: str
- motion_model
    - The indication that motion model objects are to be injected into the Animat√©Diff model is essential for the application of specific motion dynamics in the animation process.
    - Comfy dtype: MOTION_MODEL_ADE
    - Python dtype: MotionModelPatcher

### Optional
- ad_settings
    - The optional settings of the Animat√©Diff process allow for the self-defined animated appearance and behaviour.
    - Comfy dtype: AD_SETTINGS
    - Python dtype: AnimateDiffSettings

## Output types
- MOTION_MODEL
    - Comfy dtype: MOTION_MODEL_ADE
    - An enhanced AnimateDiff model with I2V functionality was injected and prepared for animation missions.
    - Python dtype: MotionModelPatcher

## Usage tips
- Infra type: CPU
- Common nodes: unknown
